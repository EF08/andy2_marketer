/**
 * Frees the automation profile before launching, by closing only the Chrome
 * processes that are actually using it.
 *
 * The hard rule here: never kill Chrome we didn't start. An earlier version fell back to
 * `Get-Process chrome | Stop-Process -Force` when its targeted kill failed — which took
 * out Andy's personal browsing and the crawler's browser along with it, and left those
 * profiles flagged as crashed ("Restore pages?"). And that targeted kill failed *every*
 * time, because its PowerShell was double-quoted inside a double-quoted -Command string.
 *
 * If nothing owns the profile, the lockfile is simply a leftover from an ungraceful exit,
 * and removing that file is the correct fix — not killing browsers.
